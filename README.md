# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository. 

Through `setup.sh` one should have (mostly) everything configured in a single command.

The tools used are:

## Alacritty

> Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but allows for extensive configuration. By integrating with other applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to provide a flexible set of features with high performance. The supported platforms currently consist of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

## Zsh + Oh My Zsh

> Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration.

## Tmux

> tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

## NeoVim with LazyVim

> LazyVim is a Neovim setup powered by ðŸ’¤ lazy.nvim to make it easy to customize and extend your config. Rather than having to choose between starting from scratch or using a pre-made distro, LazyVim offers the best of both worlds - the flexibility to tweak your config as needed, along with the convenience of a pre-configured setup.
