# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository.

Through `setup-{linux,osx}.sh` one should have (mostly) everything pre-configured
in a single command.

After running the script, make sure to re-open the terminal (now with tmux)
and type `<prefix> + I`. It will install all missing plugins for tmux.

The tools used are the following.

## Alacritty

> Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults,
> but allows for extensive configuration. By integrating with other applications,
> rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to provide a flexible
> set of features with high performance. The supported platforms currently consist
> of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

## Tmux

> tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be
created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached
from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

## Tmuxinator (Mac-Only)

## NeoVim with LazyVim

> LazyVim is a Neovim setup powered by ðŸ’¤ lazy.nvim to make it easy to
customize and extend your config. Rather than having to choose between
starting from scratch or using a pre-made distro, LazyVim offers the best
of both worlds - the flexibility to tweak your config as needed, along with
the convenience of a pre-configured setup.
